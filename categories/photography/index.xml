      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before receiving my Fujifilm X100S I bought a Sandisk UHS-1 64GB rated for 95MB/s. After unboxing the X100S I immediately formatted the card within the camera, took some shots and removed the card to view the pictures on my PC. I was surprised to see that my ArchLinux machine couldn&amp;rsquo;t read the card out of the box. I then discovered that the X100S formats the at least the 64GB cards with exFAT filesystem while using the regular FAT32 for smaller cards such as 16GB (haven&amp;rsquo;t tested 32GB yet). After installing two packages on my Linux machine I was able to read the card but this made me look at this so called exFAT filesystem. After reading about the exFAT limitations I decided to re-format my 64GB SD card with FAT32 for better robustness and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
