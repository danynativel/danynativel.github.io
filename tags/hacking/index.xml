      <title>Fixing Cressi Drake Max Dive Time</title>

      <description>When I received my brand new Cressi Drake dive computer watch, all the historical fields (dynamic, static) were blank except one field in the Pro/Free mode and which is the longest time spent in free dive (middle line, right). It was set to 0&amp;rsquo;26&amp;rdquo; and I thought that after my first dive which, will be more than 0&amp;rsquo;26&amp;rdquo;, the historical 0&amp;rsquo;26&amp;rdquo; would disappear and reflect my dives. After my first session, where I did a dive in Pro mode for 1&amp;rsquo;27&amp;rdquo;, the counter hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed and after further looking at it I noticed a little 2 digit on top of it that could indicate 20&amp;rsquo;26&amp;rdquo; instead of 0&amp;rsquo;26&amp;rdquo; and that could explain why this counter will never be updated since no humans can hold his breath for over 20 minutes, at least when breathing regular air.</description>

      <title>Clone MiFare cards using Chinesse UUID writable cards</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;libnfc supports UUID writable cards and even has some dedicated tools for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work with some of the cards found on eBay that are even simpler to use. Sector 0 is unlocked and can be written without any additional commands. libnfc requires a small patch to get it working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following has been tested under ArchLinux with modified libnfc 1.5.1, mfoc 0.10.2 and a SCL3711 dongle.&lt;/p&gt;
